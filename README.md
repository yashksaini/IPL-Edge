## About the Project

IPL Edge Game is a cutting-edge cricket simulation that brings the thrill of IPL matches to your screen. With its intuitive interface and attention to detail, this application offers users a chance to not just watch, but participate in thrilling cricket showdowns.

The application is built using React for its dynamic user interface and seamless updates. CSS is employed to design visually appealing screens that replicate the look and feel of an actual cricket match.

The game consists of multiple screens that closely mirror the stages of a real IPL match. Users start by selecting two teams out of the 10 available options. The game enforces the rule that the chosen teams must be different, adding a strategic element to the selection process.

Moving forward, users decide on the number of overs for the game from a range of options â€“ 20, 10, 5, or 2. This selection influences the pacing and intensity of the game.

Team composition is a crucial aspect of cricket, and this is authentically captured in the application. Users are tasked with forming a balanced team considering player roles (batsman, bowler, wicketkeeper, all-rounder) and the restrictions in place (e.g., minimum 6 bowlers, 1 wicketkeeper, maximum 4 overseas players). The players' abilities are quantified with batting and bowling powers, affecting their in-game performance.

Toss, another integral part of cricket, is simulated where the winning team chooses to bat or bowl based on their strategy. The actual gameplay unfolds in the game screen, where users make real-time decisions on player positions and bowling selections.

The game calculates runs based on over, batsman power, and bowler power, providing a dynamic and unpredictable experience. Realistic commentary accompanies each ball, enhancing the immersive feel.

Ongoing updates include the display of the current run rate, toss winner, total runs, and wickets for the batting team. The application also provides insights such as over summaries, commentary, and detailed scorecards for both innings.

As the first innings concludes, users switch roles, and the second team attempts to chase down the target within the set overs. This adds an additional layer of excitement and strategy, creating a complete IPL match experience.
